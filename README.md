# PartiallyConditionedGrangerCausality
Code for partially conditioned Granger causality using the covariance matrix (see below for other estimators though).

This function implements the method described in

Marinazzo et al, Causal information approach to partial conditioning in multivariate data sets, Comput Math Methods Med. 2012;2012:303601. doi: 10.1155/2012/303601

https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cmmm/2012/303601/

Instructions are in the pdf file.

# You can also use another nongaussian estimator

For example the classical Mutual Information, or the Kernel Granger Causality (ht, tps://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.77.056215, ht)tps://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.144103, https://github.com/danielemarinazzo/KernelGrangerCausality).

These files (still in beta version, are those containing MIexact or kernel in their names.

# if your data is in 3D, separated in trials, use the functions containing the word trial
